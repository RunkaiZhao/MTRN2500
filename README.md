# MTRN2500
Computing for Mechatronic Engineers
This course will use Matlab as the primary computational engine for teaching the students to carry out fundamental computations as well as developing simulations through the use of object oriented concepts implemented in Matlab environment. The basic Matlab content consists of Data types, matrices, vectors, multidimensional arrays and standard Matlab scripting using programming constructs. Non language specific object oriented concepts will be explained to assist software development using tools such as Matlab. The latter part of Matlab will use the object oriented concepts learned to develop object oriented approaches using Matlab and will develop applications for fundamental optimization, differentiators, integrators and transforms. The student will also be taught software interfaces between Matlab and C++ for visualization of massive data in 1D, 2D and 3D plots, mesh and surface plots, image acquisition and manipulation as well as the development of animations.
